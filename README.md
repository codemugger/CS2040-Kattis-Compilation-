Refer at your own risk. Some of my solutions may not be optimal in terms of time efficiency and space complexity. I am more than willing to learn from anyone if you feel there are ways to optimise my codes. :) 

Special credits to my friends, lecturers, profs and TAs for helping me to at least survive coding. Why am I creating this? Well perhaps to be more accountable to my standards and uphold them, given by slower learning pace. I know i'm probably not the brightest, but i am willing to learn :) Please guide me senpais and senseis!
